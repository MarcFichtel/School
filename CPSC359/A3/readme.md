# CPSC 359

## Assignment 3

### Objective:
Build a simple device driver for a SNES controller. The driver will be used in the next assignment as the primary input device for your interactive game. This assignment is a step towards building the interactive video game in Assignment 4. Write clean modular code that can be easily used in Assignment 4. Try to keep the same teams between Assignment 3 and Assignment 4. The team size for these two assignments is up to 3 members. 

### Deliverables: 
1. Print creator name(s) at the beginning.
2. Print “Please press button...”.
3. Wait for user input.
4. If user presses a button, print a message on the screen indicating the button pressed.
5. Loop back to step 2 if any key other than START is pressed.
6. Pressing the “START” button will end the program displaying an exit message.

### Example Session:
* Created by: John Smith and Sarah Smith
* Please press a button...
* (User Presses Joy-pad RIGHT button)
* You have pressed Joy-pad RIGHT
* Please press a button...
* (User Presses Y button)
* You have pressed Y
* Please press a button...
* (User Presses START button)
* Program is terminating...

### Notes:
1. Use at least the following subroutines:
  * Init_GPIO: This subroutine initializes a GPIO line, the line number and function code must be passed as parameters. The subroutine does not have to be general: It just needs to work for the three SNES lines.
  * Write_Latch: Writes a bit to the GPIO latch line 
  * Write_Clock: Writes a value to the GPIO Clock line
  * Read_Data: Reads a bit from the GPIO data line
  * Wait: Waits for a time interval, passed as a parameter.
  * Read_SNES: Main SNES subroutine that reads input (buttons pressed) from a SNES controller. Returns the code of a pressed button in a register.
  * Print_Message: Prints an appropriate message to the UART terminal (Press a button, You pressed X, etc ..) The message address is passed as a parameter.

You may use our supplied UART I/O subroutines that were used in the previous assignment.

2. Submit a tar-ball of your entire project directory, including makefile, source code, objects and compiled kernel.img, as a file named c359-<student_id>-a3.tar.gz 

### Grading: 
1. Display creator names & messages   (1)
2. Correctly reading/printing buttons (10)
3. Following APCS                     (4)
4. Using subroutines                  (6)
5. Loop back (not “START”)            (2)
6. Well documented code               (2)
Total                                 25 points

Programs that do not compile cannot receive more than 5 points. Programs that compile, but do not implement any of the functionality described above can receive a maximum of 7 points.

### Teams:  
You are advised to work with two other students in class in order to complete the assignment, but you are not required to do so. You and your partner must be in tutorials taught by the same TA. Peer evaluation in teams may be conducted. Keep in mind that it is preferable to keep this same team for Assignment 4.

### Submission: 
Submit your source code to the drop box on D2L. Only one submission per team is required. 

### Late Submission Policy: 
Late submissions will be penalized as follows:
* 12.5% for each late day or portion of a day for the first two days
* 25% for each additional day or portion of a day after the first two days

Hence, no submissions will be accepted after 5 days (including weekend days) of the announced deadline.
