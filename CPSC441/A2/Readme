Running the Tester
==================
1. To compile:

	./make.sh

2. To run: 

	./run.sh server port

The tester reads a list of "object paths" on the server from a text file named "url.txt". Each line of the text file represents one absolute object path in the form

	/path/dir/obj.ext

The arguments "server" and "port" specify the host name and port number of the web server.


Sample Output with Multi-Threaded Web Server
============================================
If the requests are served by the web server in parallel, then the output should contain a sequence of messages similar to the following, with "test finished" message at the end:

Sample Output with Single-Threaded Web Server
============================================
On the other hand, if the requests are served by the server sequentially, the tester will print a sequence of messages and then waits indefinitely, i.e., no "test finished" message is printed:
