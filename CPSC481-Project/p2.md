# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi Prototypes

## Video Prototype

Click [Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/145dNdQ4Q8ehh_FCW_GMbvaTnDbHvBwcZnExaVboQUOI/edit?usp=sharing) for the Google Slides presentation containing the **video prototype**.

## Storyboard

![Storyboard](storyboard.jpg)

The **storyboard** focuses on the order input interaction a waiter/waitress performs while taking customers' orders.
1) Frame shows restaurant front to clarify the action takes place in a restaurant.
2) Frame shows waiter/waitress walking up to customers with the app open and ready for input.
3) Frame shows app, waiter/waitress clicks a button to take in a new order.
4) Frame shows waiter/waitress writing down the order "classically" (with pen & paper) onto the app screen
5) Frame shows waiter/waitress confirming the order with customers and submitting it.
6) Frame shows the order being transmitted to the kitchen, where it will be processed.

## Task-Centered System Walkthrough

### Alex, waitress, mid 30's: Taking customers’ orders & serving them

| **Task Step**                 | **Knowledgeable? Motivated? Believable?** | **Comments/suggested fixes**  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Comes to the restaurant to start work. The restaurant opens. Walks up to first customers. | Yes. Yes. Yes. | |
| Greets customers and opens app to start taking their order. | Yes. Somewhat. Somewhat. | This is based on the assumption that Alex was given time to familiarize herself with the tool. A preference for the way order taking is usually done (pen & paper) will likely decrease motivation. Years of taking orders with pen and paper make it less believable that opening the app will be remembered at first when walking up to customers. |
| Inputs order into the system. | Yes. No. Yes. | Again, under the assumption that there was time to understand the system beforehand, this task should be doable, though Alex would probably prefer to do this the ‘normal’ way still. |
| Goes into kitchen to make sure the order was, in fact received. | Yes. Yes. Yes. | Knowing the system performs as expected will raise motivation to keep working with it. |
| Order is marked as ‘Done’ from within the kitchen. Alex delivers customers’ order. Customers pay. | Yes. Yes. Yes. | The rest of the system’s functionality is not used by Alex at this point, so completing the customers’ visit happens as usual. |

## Brainstorm and Affinity Diagram

### Affinity Diagram

![Affinity Diagram](affinity_diagram.jpg)

The **affinity diagram** shows all of the ideas we came up with during our brainstorming session arranged by affinity. The categories we divided the ideas into are
* Order Input
* Overall System Design / Layout
* Staff communication features
* Miscellaneous / Other

### Brainstorming

![Brainstorming1](brainstorm1.jpg)
![Brainstorming2](brainstorm2.jpg) 

We came up with the following ideas during our brainstorming session:
* Make the system as a mobile app, since mobility is a key factor for waiters
* Including some degree of gamification in the system
* In-app messaging between staff members
* Making order input a game customers have to play through (i.e. a jump 'n' run game where platforms represent dishes to add to an order)
* Adding dishes to an order by taking pictures to cater to the "We want what they're having" situation
* Scanning barcodes in the menu to add an item to an order
* Making the system voice-operatable to increase accessability
* Having the system send print jobs to a printer to print orders nicely formatted directly in the kitchen
* Adding a semi-random item from some category to suprise orders 
* Using a drag n'n drop GUI for order input
* Using the system like a note pad to allow for more traditional order input
* Adding Google Glass integration to operate the system
* Adding smart watch integration to operate the system

### Polishing Ideas

![PolishedIdeas](polished_ideas.jpg)

For the three ideas to polish, we picked one idea for each of the focus points *Usability*, *Accessability*, and *Innovation* that we believe to be essential.
* **Mobile App**: We want the system to be a mobile app, because the mobility of a mobile app will increase the usability of the system (as opposed to something like one centralized work computer that staff members have access to). Additionally, this will allow for concurrent use of the system between multiple staff members.
* **Notepad Input**: Especially among small to medium restaurants, using an ordering system is not very common. This can have multiple reasons, one of which is that staff members, especially waiters, in these establishments tend to be a little older of less technically savvy than in bigger or chain restaurants. Because of this, we wanted one of these core features to focus on accessability. In order to make the system more accessable, we want to support a more traditional order input method, where waiters can write down an order on the app with some kind of tablet pen. The order then gets transformed into normal computerized text, so that the waiter can confirm with customers that the order is correct, and that the system understood the waiters writing correctly (to add a sense of security to the user).
* **Gamification**: In order to try something not before seen in the context of restaurant ordering systems, as well as increase user engagement, we want to gamify the system. This may be done in several forms, the most obvious of which would be to award points to a user for completing certain actions. This may come with several benefits for the user if the frequency of the action is based on skill or motivation alone (i.e. increase the percentage of the tip pool given to users). Gamified aspects would have to be kept at a minimal level in order to not overwhelm or distract users.

## Reflection

### What went well

Overall, we were happy with how the ideation process happened. Most tasks went very well. Brainstorming was quick, yet effective. We decided to brainstorm ideas separately in part, and compare results later, followed by another short bit of brainstorming together based on the compared results. This was good, because it gave both of us time to think creatively, and it prevented us from influencing each other’s thoughts as we were brainstorming. We believe that this might be especially effective the more participants a brainstorming group has, because everyone is involved, including those who vocalize their ideas less than others. Sorting through ideas, picking promising ones, and creating a storyboard also happened very smoothly. With a group size of two, it was very easy for us to reach a consensus. Tutorial exercises had given us a good base from which to start all the required tasks, so there was no disagreement on what we wanted to do for each step.

### What could have gone better

Among things that could be improved is the breadth of the spectrum of ideas we came up with during brainstorming. With only two people in the group and motivation not as high as could have been due to other factors (studying for midterms, working on other assignments, etc.), we believe the number of ideas brainstormed was somewhat smaller than it might have been otherwise. Additionally, having gone through many tutorial exercises had already given us a solid idea of what we wanted out of this project, so going back to step 1 with brainstorming felt repetitive and maybe a bit unnecessary. Nonetheless, we believe the entire ideation process turned to have excellent results, including new ideas we had not thought of before.

### What would we do differently

Since we are relatively happy with our collaboration on this, we would not change much if given the same task again. One improvement would be to polish our ideas a bit more before creating a storyboard, as we had some very small misunderstandings (which were quickly resolved) when creating the storyboard for this assignment. Another small improvement would be to make several storyboard versions, whereas we made only one. This way, the final storyboard quality might have improved a little.
