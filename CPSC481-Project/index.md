## Project Idea

![Order.ly Home](highlight1.png)

Restaurants have one of the busiest and most fast-paced work environments in the food industry. We wanted to create an application to assist restaurant workers and ensure their job goes as smoothly as possible. We learned a lot about how restaurants really work, and how hard their job can sometimes be. Using what we learned, we attempted to make an application that will tend to our usersâ€™ needs. The step-by-step process of coming up with ideas and bringing them to life was an enriching and invaluable experience.
