# CPSC 503 - Project in Computer Science

An interdepartmental research project between the departments of Computer Science and Classics & Religion.

## An Exploration of the Roman House as an interactive performance stage

From the final report:
This paper describes a computer program that was created as a research tool for archaeologists studying theatrical performances in the House of the Golden Cupids (Casa Degli Amorini Dorati) in ancient Romeâ€™s Pompeii. By being able to manipulate objects and external influences, researchers can put forth and test informed hypotheses, and share their findings with others. To facilitate quick prototyping and iteration in the development process, the game development engine Unity3D was used.
